# Change log

All notable changes to the `launchdarkly-js-sdk-common` package will be documented in this file. Changes that affect the dependent SDKs such as `launchdarkly-js-client-sdk` should also be logged in those projects, in the next release that uses the updated version of this package. This project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org).


Prior to the 2.15.0 release, this code was a monorepo subpackage in the [`js-client-sdk`](https://github.com/launchdarkly/js-client-sdk) repo. See the [changelog](https://github.com/launchdarkly/js-client-sdk/blob/2.14.0/CHANGELOG.md) in that repo for changes prior to that version. It is now maintained in this repo and has its own versioning and changelog.
